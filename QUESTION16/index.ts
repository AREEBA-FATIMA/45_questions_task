//16.	More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.
// • Start with your program from Exercise 15. Add a print statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger dinner table.
// • Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.
// • Add one new guest to the middle of your array. • Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list. • Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.

// let guests : string[] = ["Areeba Fatima", "Anmol Fatima", "Muqaddas fatima"]

// guests.map((item) => console.log( `Dear ${item}, I found a bigger table for u`))

// let guestBegin : string = "Umm-e-Habiba"
// guests.unshift(guestBegin)
// console.log(guests)

// let middleGuest : string = "Ajwah Fatima"
// let middleIndex = guests.length/2
// guests.splice(middleIndex ,0, middleGuest)
// console.log(guests)

// let lastGuest = "Hoorain Fatima"
// guests.push(lastGuest)
// console.log(guests)
